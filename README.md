# Star Wars Movies Project

This is a small demo project, showcasing the amazing old Star Wars movies.

You can search for a particular movie and sort the list of movies based on a few different criteria.
You can also view the movie details, poster and ratings for each one.

## How to start the project

1. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production build to preview
3. Run `npm run preview` and navigate to the assigned localhost port to view the project

## Potential future improvements

- Filter movies by director, producer, description
- Add error handling
- Merge ratings & poster data with the movie data structure on app load
- Beautify the UI further
- Rebuild the project as an SSR (e.g. with Next.js) to fetch the data at build time (since the site is mostly static anyways)
